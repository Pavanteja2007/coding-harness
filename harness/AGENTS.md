# AGENTS.md — Terminal 1: Harness Core & Context Management

## What's built (Phase 1 + Round 2: resume, structural retrieval)

The full agent loop: given a `Task` (issue + repo), retrieve context, plan
sub-steps, edit a working copy via bash, verify, and retry with feedback —
implemented per `INTERFACES.md` Boundaries 3 & 4 and the context-management
ideas in `project-spec.md` (items 12/14/15/16/17).

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `core.py` | **`run_task(task, log_root=None) -> TaskResult`** (Boundary 3). Attempt loop, per-step sessions, stopping conditions, verifier-gated completion, **resume contract (Round 2, see below)**. |
| `context.py` | Structured state file `logs/{task_id}/state.json` in the exact Boundary 4 schema (atomic rewrite; `reset_completed()` on retry rollback; **resume hydration + `plan.json` bookkeeping**). |
| `trace.py` | Append-only `trace.jsonl`: every prompt, model response, tool call, tool result, verify, decision. **Survives relaunches (appended to on resume).** |
| `config.py` | All tunables from `task.config` merged over `DEFAULTS` (retries, budget, wall-clock, caps, protected paths…). |
| `retrieval.py` | **Two layers (Round 2)**: structural (imports/call-graph via Terminal 4's `memory.code_graph`, anchored on the target test + subword symbol matching) merged with the Phase-1 grep layer. Returns a `strategy` note. |
| `tools.py` | **Bash-only action space** (mini-swe-agent style): one command per turn, output-capped, `SUBMIT` ends a step, deny-pattern guard. |
| `editor.py` | Snapshot/restore of working copies, difflib unified diff, pre-verify validation (protected paths, Python syntax). |
| `prompts.py` | Planner prompt (2–4 sub-steps, each with checkpoint — no one-shotting; now states the retrieval strategy), step-session prompts, **constraint re-injection block appended to every tool result**. |
| `model_client.py` | Wraps Boundary 2 `call_model`: trace logging, usage/cost accounting via `get_last_usage()` convention, `TaskResult.model_calls` records. |
| `deps.py` | **The swap point**: tries real `execution.sandbox` / `runtime.model_router` / `memory.code_graph` first, falls back to `harness/_stubs/`. Tests inject fakes via `set_call_model` / `set_execute_sandboxed`. |
| `_stubs/` | Local stubs with exact contract signatures: subprocess sandbox, pytest-based `verify()`, single-provider litellm router (lazy import). **All three real modules have now landed; stubs are fallback-only.** |

## Round 2 changes

### Task A — resume/checkpoint contract (fixes the cross-module bug)

**Bug**: `_fresh_paths` archived `logs/{task_id}/` wholesale on every
relaunch, so Terminal 3's runtime-side checkpoint/resume could never
actually resume — state.json (the progress authority) was swept away
before the relaunched run could read it.

**Fix** (core.py + context.py):
- `run_task` now implements the resume contract: when
  `task.config["resume"]` is truthy AND the prior `state.json` has
  completed steps AND a readable `plan.json` exists → **resume**, else
  the old archive-then-fresh behavior (unchanged for non-resume callers —
  regression-tested).
- Resume keeps `logs/{task_id}/` intact: hydrates `TaskState` from the
  real state.json (decisions/files_touched/completed_steps preserved),
  **reuses the persisted plan** (new `plan.json`, harness-internal —
  re-planning could orphan recorded step descriptions), skips completed
  steps (`step_skipped_resume` trace event), keeps the surviving
  `pristine/`+`work/` dirs (partial edits are built upon, not thrown
  away), continues the **in-flight attempt** (a crash is an
  interruption, not a verification failure — no `max_retries` slot
  consumed), and seeds the budget cap with the pre-crash spend.
- Baseline verify is skipped on resume (a passing baseline would have
  ended the pre-crash run before any step completed; re-running it
  cannot change the outcome).
- `trace.jsonl` is appended to across relaunches — pre-kill events
  survive as first-class history.
- Degrades safely: unreadable state.json/plan.json or missing
  pristine/work → fresh start (trace event `resume_aborted`), never a
  crash or nonsense-resume.

**Proof**: `tests/test_e2e_run_task.py::test_resume_after_hard_kill_mid_run`
mirrors Terminal 3's scheduler scenario through the REAL loop: a child
process (tests/resume_driver.py) is hard-killed via `os._exit(70)` after
step 1 of 2 completes, the relaunch resumes from the real state.json,
skips step 1, finishes step 2 from the surviving partial edit, and
succeeds with attempts=1. Plus: non-resume relaunch still archives
(regression guard), corrupted state → fresh, missing copies → fresh.

### Task B — smarter context retrieval (Phase 2 scope)

`retrieval.py` grew a structural layer on top of the Phase-1 grep layer:
- Consumes **Terminal 4's `memory.code_graph`** (tree-sitter; via
  `deps.get_code_graph_factory()`) — one structural index for the whole
  project, no harness-private duplicate. Explicitly invited by
  memory/AGENTS.md.
- **Target-test anchor** (the key mechanism): the target test's file →
  its import edges → the module under test; its call edges → the symbols
  it exercises. Finds the right files even when the issue text names
  NOTHING (proved by test: issue "something is off in how numbers are
  summarized" → `numlib/mathutil.py` via anchor).
- **Subword symbol matching**: `compute_monthly_total` decomposes to
  {compute, monthly, total}, so an issue saying "monthly total is
  doubled" matches without the identifier ever appearing in the issue.
- **Call-graph neighborhood**: matched symbols expand one hop to direct
  callers/callees (the failing test is often the caller; the true defect
  often a callee).
- Structural scores outrank grep hits (×2 merge weight); the index lives
  at `logs/_code-graph/` (SHARED across tasks, OUTSIDE the original repo
  — the never-mutate guarantee holds; regression-tested) and is reused
  across tasks on the same repo (mtimes don't change on a read-only
  repo).
- Fully best-effort: graph module missing/broken → grep-only with
  `strategy: "grep"` (tested via monkeypatched broken factory). No
    embedding layer — true synonym gaps ("average" vs `mean()`) remain
  future work (would need an embedding index; documented below).
- Planner prompt now tells the model which strategy produced its
  context; `trace.jsonl` records the retrieval decision
  (`retrieval` event: strategy/terms/files).

### Task C — Terminal 2's real sandbox/verify: LANDED and verified

`deps.py` auto-resolution picked up `execution.sandbox` +
`execution.verify` the moment they landed — **no code changes needed**.
Verified explicitly:
- `verify(repo_path, target_test, rerun_for_flake_check=1,
  test_command=None, verify_timeout_s=300, *, allow_network=False)` —
  the `test_command`/`verify_timeout_s` kwargs I flagged in the Change
  Log are honored exactly (defaults match; used for both target and
  suite runs, node ids appended).
- `execute_sandboxed` = exact Boundary-1 signature + safe keyword-only
  extras. My e2e suite (real bash through real Docker) passes: 20/20.
- **Deliberate non-change**: Terminal 2 suggests core.py could catch
  `SandboxUnavailableError` and fall back to the subprocess stub. I
  did NOT add silent fallback — "sandboxed must mean sandboxed"; a
  down Docker yields task status "error" (loud, diagnosable, and the
  runtime's crash_retries governs relaunching). Opt-in degraded mode
  can be a future config key if ever wanted.
- Sandbox timeout convention (exit 124 + timed_out=True) matches the
  stub's, so my step-session and feedback logic is unchanged.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **Agent never touches the original repo.** Every run snapshots the repo
  into `logs/{task_id}/pristine/` + `work/`; diffs are computed between
  those; `restore_dir()` rolls back between attempts. A stale
  `logs/{task_id}/` from a prior non-resume run is archived as
  `{task_id}.old-*`, never deleted; a RESUME relaunch keeps it (Task A).
- **Verifier-gated completion is absolute.** `status="success"` is only
  set when `verify()` confirms target test pass + full-suite regression
  pass + not flaky. `SUBMIT` only ends a step session. If the target
  already passes on the pristine copy, the task short-circuits to success
  with zero model calls (proved by an `ExplodingModel` test).
- **Model defaults are `None`** in `config.DEFAULTS` (model/provider/
  api_key). An unset value means "let the router decide" — Terminal 3's
  adaptive routing depends on this; pin values in `task.config` to force
  a model.
- **Multi-line commands are first-class.** `_extract_command` keeps
  fenced blocks and bare heredocs whole (a beheaded `python - <<EOF`
  heredoc was a real test-caught bug).
- **Constraint re-injection rides every tool result** (end of message =
  max recency): issue one-liner, current step, remaining steps, protected
  paths, "don't modify tests".
- **Failure feedback flows both ways**: step-to-step (intra-attempt) and
  attempt-to-attempt (after rollback). Feedback includes the verifier's
  raw output tail, not just "it failed".
- **Resume granularity is step-level** (state.json's granularity): a
  crash mid-step re-runs that step from its partial edits in work/; a
  crash after a step-completion skips it. `plan.json` (steps +
  in-flight attempt + spent cost) is the harness-internal bookkeeping
  that makes "continue the interrupted attempt" well-defined.

## What's stubbed / mocked, and why

- **All three real boundary modules have landed** (execution.sandbox,
  execution.verify, runtime.model_router, memory.code_graph); `deps.py`
  resolves them automatically. `harness/_stubs/` remains only as the
  import-error fallback (e.g. Docker-less dev machines) and as the
  explicit "want the old behavior" import path per Terminal 2's AGENTS.
- Tests use `tests/fake_model.py` (`ScriptedModel` / `ExplodingModel`)
  injected through `deps.set_call_model` — no network, deterministic,
  real bash + real Docker sandbox + real pytest runs in e2e tests.
  `tests/resume_driver.py` runs the real loop in a child process so
  hard-kill tests don't take pytest down with them.

## Definition of Done — where it stands

Five genuinely different bugs (boundary condition, off-by-one, missing
guard, undefined name, mutable default) in five fixture repos under
`tests/fixtures/bug0{1..5}_*/`. The e2e suite fixes all five with real
bash commands through the full stack (now against the REAL Docker
sandbox), each producing a valid `state.json` (exact Boundary 4 key
order) and complete `trace.jsonl`. Loop behaviors covered by tests:
verifier-gating (model claims SUBMIT without fixing → task FAILS),
retry-recovery (syntax-error attempt → clean fix on attempt 2),
max-retries, budget cap, wall-clock timeout, protected-path rejection
(agent tries editing tests → blocked), original-repo-never-mutated, and
(Round 2) hard-kill → relaunch → resume; non-resume relaunch archives;
corrupt/missing resume state degrades to fresh.

**Test status:** 68 harness tests pass (`python -m pytest
tests/test_config_trace_state.py tests/test_stubs_and_deps.py
tests/test_retrieval_tools.py tests/test_editor_prompts.py
tests/test_e2e_run_task.py`), including the 4 new resume tests and 6
new structural-retrieval tests.

## Known issues / flags for other terminals

- **Terminal 2 (execution):** your verify() kwargs landed exactly as
  requested — closed out, thanks. Not adopting the suggested
  SandboxUnavailableError→stub fallback (fail-loud is the right
  default; see Task C note above).
- **Terminal 3 (runtime):** the resume contract is LIVE — your worker's
  `cfg["resume"]=True` + state.json gate now actually resumes the real
  harness (plan reuse, step skip, attempt continuation, budget seed).
  No runtime-side changes needed. Your 3 scheduler-test failures noted
  in Round 1 were yours (fake-harness-pinned) and untouched by this
  round.
- **Terminal 4 (memory):** `retrieval.py` now consumes
  `memory.code_graph.CodeGraph` programmatically (load_or_build + raw
  Graph nodes/edges; NOT the string `query()` surface). Contract
  addition logged in INTERFACES.md. `state.json` schema unchanged;
  `decisions` now also records the resume decision. Keep the
  Graph/NodeInfo dataclasses stable-ish or flag in the Change Log.
- **All:** `logs/_code-graph/` is the shared structural index root
  (repo-keyed subdirs); `logs/{task_id}/plan.json` is
  harness-internal (not Boundary 4) — don't parse it from outside the
  harness.

## What's next (Phase 3 hooks, not started)

- Failure classification feeding repair strategy (spec item 24/25 — the
  naive-retry loop's `last_feedback` is the seam where it plugs in).
- `query_structure`/`query_decisions` MCP calls woven into step context
  (Boundary 5) now that Terminal 4's server is up — retrieval could
  consult decision memory for "we fixed something like this before".
- Embedding-based retrieval for true synonym gaps (issue says
  "average", symbol is `mean()`) — subword matching covers identifier
  decomposition but not vocabulary; would need a local embedding index
  (ChromaDB experience per spec Phase 2).
